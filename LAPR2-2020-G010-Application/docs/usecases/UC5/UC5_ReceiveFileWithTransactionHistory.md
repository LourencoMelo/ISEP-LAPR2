# UC5 - Receive file with transaction history## 1. Requirements engineering### Brief FormatThe user it´s on the window that permits to do the use case. Selects the file that wants to import and the systems searches the file with the transaction history and saves and instances.### SSD## Main scenario![UC5_SSD1.svg](UC5_SSD1.svg)### Complete format#### Main actor* User (Main Scenario)#### Partes interessadas e seus interesses* ** T4J Admin ** Wants that users have the hability to import files.* ** User ** Wants to import a file of his preference. #### Preconditions* Existing file with the right conditions. #### Postconditions* The system saves and instances the information.### Main success scenario (or basic flow)1. User selects a file that he wants to use.2. The file is found.3. The system reads the file and saves and instances. And warns that has been successful saved.#### Extensions (or alternatives flows)2a. The file is not found>	1. The system shows the error>	>	1.a The use case ends.		>	1.b The systems allows a introduction of a new file, in a separated try.#### Special requirements\-#### List of Technology Variations and Data\-#### Frequency of Occurrence\- Every time the user wants to import a file.#### Open questions* At the same run of the program you can import multiple files or one file at the run time?## 2.

User selects a file that he wants to use. | Who is the user?... | Colaborator | Only the Manager and Colaborator of the Organization have these function | | 2. The file is found. | Who controls that? | ApplicationController | Controls the methods that are essancials to the application. || 3. The system reads the file and saves and instances. | Who registers the data?... | TransactionRegister | It´s the class (of associated to that info) that will receive and save all the information in each class... |### Systematization ##From the racional results on the conceptual classes  promoted to software classes are:* User* Colaborator* Platform* Task* Freelancer * PaymentTransactionOther software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:   * TransactionRegister  * Date###	Diagrama de Sequência#### Main scenario![UC5_SD.svg](UC5_SD.svg)#### Secondary scenario![UC5_SD1.svg](UC5_SD1.svg)###	Diagrama de Classes![UC5_CD.svg](UC5_CD.svg)### WarningIn this use case we should had create an interface to have the hability to receive, in a easier way, many types of files. It would be good for maintainance of code, if it was necessary to add one more type of file..
