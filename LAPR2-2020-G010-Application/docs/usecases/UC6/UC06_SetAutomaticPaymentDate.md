# UC6 - Set automatic payment date## 1. Requirements engineering### Brief FormatThe manager of the organization starts the setting of the automatic payment date. The system asks for the necessary data (the day of the month and the time of the day). The manager of the organization  enters the requested data. The system validates and presents the data to the manager of the organization, asking him to confirm it. The manager of the organization confirms. The system records the data and informs the manager of the organization to the success of the operation.### SSD![UC6_SSD.svg](UC6_SSD.svg)### Full Format#### Main actor*   Manager of the Organization#### Stakeholders and their interests* **The Manager of the Organization:** want to set the automatic payment date.* **Organization:** want their task's with a payment date defined.* **T4J:** intends that organizations can pay to their freelancers.#### Preconditions* Existing tasks previously created in the system.#### Postconditions* Saving the automatic payment date for the taks in the system.###  Main success scenario (or basic flow)1.  The manager of the organization starts the setting of the automatic payment date.2.  The system asks for the necessary data (the day of the month and the time of the day).3.  The manager of the organization  enters the requested data.4.  The system validates and presents the data to the manager of the organization, asking him to confirm it.5.  The manager of the organization confirms. 6.  The system records the data and informs the manager of the organization to the success of the operation.#### Extensions (or alternative flows)*a. The manager of the organization requests to cancel the job specification.> The use case ends.4a. Missing minimum required data.>	1. The system informs you which data is missing.>	2. The system allows the entry of missing data (step 3)>	>	2a. The manager of the organization does not change the data. The use case ends.4b. The system detects that the data (or some subset of the data) entered must be unique and that it already exists in the system.>	1. The system alerts the manager of the organization to the fact.>	2. The system allows you to change it (step 3)>	>	2a. The manager of the organization does not change the data. The use case ends.4c. The system detects that the data entered (or some subset of the data) is invalid.> 1. The system alerts the manager of the organization to the fact.> 2. The system allows you to change it (step 3).>	> 2a. The manager of the organization does not change the data. The use case ends.#### Special requirements\-#### List of Technologies varations and Data\-#### Frequency of occurrence\- #### Open questions* There are other data that are needed?* All data is required?* How often does this use case occur?## 2.
