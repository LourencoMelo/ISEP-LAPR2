The system didn't found any tasks/transactions in the system.>The use case ends.2.b. The system didn't found any tasks/transactions that have not been paid.>The use case ends.#### Special requirements* Every time the preset hour comes and, there is a task/transaction that has not been paid yet.#### List of Technologies Variations and Data\-#### Frequency of Occurrence\-#### Open questions* Would it be relevant to have a warning that the system would give to the manager about not having found any tasks/transactions with the desired characteristics? ## 2.
