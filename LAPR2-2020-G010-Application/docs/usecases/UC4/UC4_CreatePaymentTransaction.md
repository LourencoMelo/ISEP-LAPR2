# UC4 - Create payment transaction## 1. Requirements Engineering### Brief formatThe collaborator starts creating a payment transaction. The system shows a list of freelancers and asks the collaborator to pick one. The collaborator chooses one freelancer. The system shows the list of tasks. The Collaborator chooses one task. The system asks for the details about the execution of the task (end date, delay, brief description of the quality of the work) and the ID of the transaction. The Collaborator introduces the data. The system validates, calculates and shows the amount to pay to the freelancer, then informs the Collaborator of the success of the operation.### SSD![UC4_SSD.svg](UC4_SSD.svg)### Full format #### Main actor* Collaborator#### Stakeholders and their interests* **Collaborator:** pretends to create a payment transaction;* **Freelance:**: pretends to be paid by the organization for his tasks.* **T4J:** pretends that his freelancers get paid by the organization that they made the tasks for.#### Preconditions* There needs to be done a task, by a freelancer, to be paid for.#### Postconditions* All the payments made by the organizations will be registered in a file.#### Main success scenario (or basic flow)1. The collaborator pretends to create a payment transaction.2. The system shows a list of freelancers and asks the collaborator to pick one.3. The collaborator chooses one freelancer.4. The system shows the list of tasks and asks the Collaborator to pick one.5. The Collaborator chooses one task. 6. The system asks for the details about the execution of the task (end date, delay, brief description of the quality of the work) and the transaction ID.7. The Collaborator introduces the data.8. The system validates ,calculates and shows the amount to pay to the freelancer, then informs the Collaborator of the success of the operation.#### Extensions (or alternative flow)*a. The collaborator asks to end the process.> The use case ends.*2a. The information describing the task and the freelancer is not available.> The system allows the collaborator to create a task and a freelancer in the system.8a. Missing minimum required data.>	1. The system warns about the missing data.>	2. The system allows the introduction of the missing data. (step 2)>	>	2a. The collaborator doens't change the data. The use case ends.#### Special requirements* The time duration needs to be in hours.* The cost per hour needs to be in euros.#### List of Technologies Variations and Data\-#### Frequency of Occurrence\-#### Open questions## 2.
