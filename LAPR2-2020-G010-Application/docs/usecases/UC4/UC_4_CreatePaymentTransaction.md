# UC4 - Create payment transaction## 1. Requirements Engineering### Brief formatThe collaborator starts creating a payment transaction. The system asks for the necessary data: a brief description of the task (id,brief description, time duration, cost per hour and task category), details about the execution of the task (end date, delay, brief description of the quality of the work) and information about the freelancer that worked on the task (id, name, level of expertise, e-mail, NIF, bank account (IBAN) , address and country). The collaborator introduces the data .The system validates and displays the data, asking the collaborator to confirm it. The collaborator confirms it. The system records the data about the payment transaction, shows the amount to pay to the freelancer and informs the collaborator about the success of the process.### SSD![UC4_SSD.svg](UC4_SSD.svg)### Full format #### Main actor* Collaborator#### Stakeholders and their interests* **Collaborator:** pretends to create a payment transaction;* **Freelance:**: pretends to be paid by the organization for his tasks.* **T4J:** pretends that his freelancers get paid by the organization that they made the tasks for.#### Preconditions* There needs to be done a task, by a freelancer, to be paid for.#### Postconditions* All the payments made by the organizations will be registered in a file.#### Main success scenario (or basic flow)1. The collaborator pretends to create a payment transaction.2. The system asks for the necessary data: a brief description of the task (id,brief description, time duration,           cost per hour and task category), details about the execution of the task (end date, delay, brief description of the quality of the work) and information about the freelancer that worked on the task (id, name, level of expertise, e-mail, NIF, bank account (IBAN) , address and country).3. The collaborator introduces the data.4. The system validates and displays the data, asking the collaborator to confirm it. 5. The collaborator confirms it.6. The system records the data about the payment transaction, show the amount to pay to the freelancer and informs the collaborator about the success of the process.#### Extensions (or alternative flow)*a. The collaborator asks to end the process.> The use case ends.*2a. The information describing the task and the freelancer is not available.> The system allows the collaborator to create a task and a freelancer in the system.4a. Missing minimum required data.>	1. The system warns about the missing data.>	2. The system allows the introduction of the missing data. (step 2)>	>	2a. The collaborator doens't change the data. The use case ends.#### Special requirements* The time duration needs to be in hours.* The cost per hour needs to be in euros.#### List of Technologies Variations and Data\-#### Frequency of Occurrence\-#### Open questions## 2.
