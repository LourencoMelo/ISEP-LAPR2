# UC9 - Show Freelancerâ€™s statistics## 1. Requirements Engineering### Brief FormatThe manager or the collaborator of the organization selects the option of seeing the overall statistics about task execution times (the mean and the standard deviation of the delays, of each one and of all freelancers, and a histogram to analyze the delays of each one and all the freelancers working to the organization) and the freelancer paymemts (the mean and the standard deviation of the payments made to each one of the freelancers). The system asks the user to choose between the statistics about the task execution times or the freelancer payments and if he wants the information for all the freelancers or each one. The manager/ collaborator chooses. The system shows the statistics and finalizes the process. ### SSD![LUC9_SSD](LUC9_SSD.svg)#### Main Actor* Manager/Collaborator#### Stakeholders and their interests* **Manager/Collaborator :** wants to see the overall statistics about task execution times and freelancers payments.* **T4J :** intends to show the statistics to the managers and collaborators of their platform.#### Preconditions* There needs to exist payments.#### Postconditions\-#### Main success scenario (or basic flow)1.
