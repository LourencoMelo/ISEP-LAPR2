# UC7 - Analyse Freelancer's Statistics## 1. Requirements engineering### Brief FormatThe administrator starts the analysis of both execution time and payment referred to as the freelancer. The system requests the administrator to choose between one of them. The administrator selects one option. The system shows what the administrator wants and finalizes the process.### SSD![UC7_SSD.svg](UC7_SSD.svg)### Full Format#### Main actor* Administrator#### Stakeholders and their interests* **Administrator:** wants to see the statistics of the freelancers' performances.* **T4J:** aims to satisfy organizations and their members by facilitating their desires.#### Preconditions* Delays must already exist in the system.* Payments must already exist in the system.#### Postconditions\-### Main success scenario (or basic flow)1. The administrator starts the analysis of both execution time and payment referred to as the freelancer.2. The system requests the administrator to choose between one of them.3. The administrator selects one option.4. The system shows what the administrator wants and finalizes the process.#### Extensions (or alternative flows)*a. The administrator requests  to cancel the sampling of the information.> The use case ends.#### Special requirements\-#### List of Technologies and Data Variations\-#### Frequency of Occurrence\-#### Open questions* Is there anything else the administrative wants to see?* How often does this use case occur?## 2.
