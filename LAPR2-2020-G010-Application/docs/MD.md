# OO Analysis #The domain model construction process is based on use cases, in particular, the nouns used, and the description of the statement.## Rational for identifying domain classes ##For the identification of domain classes, the list of categories of TP classes (suggested in the book) is used. As a result, we have the following table of concepts (or classes, but not software) by category.### _Category List_ ###**Transactions*** PaymentTransaction---**Transactions lines***---**Transaction-related products or services***  Task* PaymentTransaction---**Regists (transactions)***---  **Roles*** Administrator* Freelancer* Collaborator* Manager* User---**Places***  Platform---**Events*** ---**Physical objects***---**Specifications and descriptions**  *  Task* PaymentTransaction---**Catalogs***---**Sets*** RegistFreelancer* PaymentTransactionList* RegistOrganization* TaskList---**Elements sets***  ---**Organizations***  T4J (Platform)*  Organization---**Other External systems***  CoinCurrencieConvert*  ExternAlgorithmPasswordGenerator---**Records (financial), work, contracts, legal documents*** Files---**Financial tools*** PaymentTransaction---**Referred documents / to perform the tasks /***---## **Rationale about identifying associations between classes** ##| Concept (A) 		|  Association   		|  Concept (B) ||----------	   		|:-------------:		|------:       || Administrator 	| define    		 	| Organizations  ||   					| define            | Manager  ||   					| define      | Collaborator  ||						| acts as			| User ||						| works for                           | Platform || Platform		| has    | Organizations  ||						| has/uses 			| Freelancer  ||						| has     			| Administrator ||						| uses				| ExternAlgorithmPasswordGenerator	|| Organization			| has  	   | Collaborator  ||						| has     	| Manager ||						| has		     	| Task ||                                                                 | has                         | PaymentTransaction || Task		    	| specified by 	| Collaborator ||                                           | is paid by                           | PaymnetTransaction || Freelancer			| executes			| Task ||| Collaborator			| acts as			| User || 						| creates			| Tasks ||						| creates				| Freelancer	|| ExternAlgorithmPasswordGenerator			| generates passwords for	| User	|	|PaymnetTransaction                    | pays to                               | Freelancer ||Manager                                      | chooses the date               | PaymentTransaction ||                                                    | acts as                              | User |## Modelo de Dom√≠nio![MD.svg](MD.svg)
