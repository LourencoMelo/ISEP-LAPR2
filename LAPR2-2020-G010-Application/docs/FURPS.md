# Supplementary specification## Functionalities*Specifies the features that are not related to the cases ofuse, namely: Audit, Reporting and Security. *- The application should use object serialization to ensure persistence of the data between two runs  of the application. **Safety:**## Usability*Evaluates the user interface. It has several subcategories,among them: error prevention; aesthetics and design; Help anddocumentation; consistency and standards. ***Aesthetics:****Aids:**## Reliability / Reliability*Refers to the integrity, compliance and interoperability of the software. The requirements to be considered are: frequency and severity of failure, possibility of recovery, possibility of prediction, accuracy, average time between failures. *## Performance*Evaluates the performance requirements of the software, namely: response time, memory consumption, CPU usage, load capacity and application availability. *- The software development process should be iterative and incremental while adopting good  design practices and coding standards.## Supportability*The supportability requirements group several characteristics, such as:testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility,configurability, installability, scalability and more. ***Configurability:****Testability:**-  Unit tests  should be developed to validate all domain classes.## +### Design restrictions*Specifies or restricts the system design process. Examples may include: programming languages, software process, use of development tools, class library, etc. *### Implementation restrictions*Specifies or restricts the code or construction of a system suchmandatory standards, implementation languages,database integrity, resource limits, operating system. *- The application should be implemented in Java and the user interface should be implemented  using JavaFX, a Java library used to build Rich Internet Applications.- The implementation process must follow a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach.- Instead of  sending e-mails, all the e-mail messages should be written to a single file (named e-mail.txt).### Interface restrictions*Specifies or restricts the functionalities inherent to the interaction of thesystem with other external systems. *- The system should be prepared to use any e-mail service/API.- To convert  between currencies the application should use an API developed by third party companies.### Physical restrictions*Specifies a limitation or physical requirement of the hardware used, forexample: material, shape, size or weight. *
